java cFinal assignment
Refer to the file “analyze2013stormData.mlx” in Module 1 folder and follow the
instructions below to create a live script and submit your work. 1. Review criteria
Grading will be done using your final report, which should be provided as a
PDF exported from a MATLAB live script. The final report is worth 100 points. 60
Points are needed to pass. 2. Step-By-Step Assignment Instructions
2.1. Setup instructions
Use the file "Template.mlx." to create a live script for the project. The data file for the project is named "StormEvents_2018.csv."
Include a title and table of contents in your live script and the main sections
listed below (10 points). Section headings are included in the template. The
template includes the following four main sections, but you may include more:
1. Background and Scope
2. Visualizations
3. Analysis
4. Conclusions and Recommendations
2.2. Instructions for each section
Each main section in the template includes subsections for required work.2
Placing the required analysis in the correct location of the template will help your
peer-reviewer. 2.2.1.Background and Scope (25 points)
Import the 2018 data provided for this assignment. This should be done using
an import function or script. Find the two states most impacted by tornadoes in terms of total damage
). Refer to the reading to find a list of states most severely impacted by
thunderstorm wind. Create a table of events related to代 写data、Java/Python
代做程序编程语言 thunderstorm wind for the two states found
above, and save the table in a CSV file for use outside of Matlab.
. 2.2.2.Visualizations (25 points)
All visualizations must include a title.
Include these three visualizations:
 Create a figure showing the type and number of occurrences for events in the
two States most impacted by thunderstorm wind.  A figure showing the location of events with latitude and longitude reported in
every states using a different color marker for each month. This figure must
include legend.3
 A map figure showing the location of thunderstorm wind event in March
2.2.3.Analysis (25 points)
Explore the data to find the most affected month by Tornadoes. Identify the
month and state requested by the insurance company below. Place the results in the
sections provided in the template so that your peer-reviewer can easily find your
answer. You may present your findings as a visualization, table, and/or text. Create a histogram to show the number of tornadoes by month. Create a table that shows the total damage of tornadoes for each month. You report may include additional visualizations as necessary to support your
analysis. 2.2.4.Conclusions and Recommendations (15 points)
Where should the insurance company send people to? Make a
recommendation of which state should be prioritized. Refer to specific data or
figures in your report that supports your recommendation.
